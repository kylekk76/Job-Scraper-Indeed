# Job-Scraper-Indeed
This is the first proyect that i try to deal with a issue an is that i do not like much the way linked id present the jobs.

Is dificult to keep track of the diferent jobs.
Compare them
Look if you are a good fit for them, or they are for you.
if they are underpaying for the actual market of in another hand its a good pay for your work.

I would like to have the information scraped from diferent pages and create diferent metrics and have them plots on a geomap, so
i could also analyze the data and fetch what areas offer better rates or oferts to also if i want to relocate to another city,
choose an area that is faborable to find a good job.

I know i can check probably all that stats from the webpages, but as i say is a lot of click, would be wonderfull have all the
information to just one click, so that is my plan with this wee proyect.
